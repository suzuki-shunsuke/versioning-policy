# versioning-policy

This is the versioning policy which is compatible with [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/).
`Semantic Versioning 2.0.0` is awesome, but the versioning rule of `v0.x` is not defined.
So we define this policy adding the rule of `v0.x` to `Semantic Versioning 2.0.0`.

In this document, we describe only the additional rules.
When you use this policy, not only the additional rules but also `Semantic Versioning 2.0.0` are applied.

## When do we update the minor version of `v0.x`?

When the release includes the breaking change, you MUST update the minor version.
Otherwise, we MUST update the patch version.
